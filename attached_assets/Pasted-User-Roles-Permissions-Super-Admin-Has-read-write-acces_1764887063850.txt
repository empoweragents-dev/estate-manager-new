User Roles & Permissions

Super Admin: Has read/write access to ALL collections and ALL data. Can view a "Master Dashboard" aggregating data from all owners.

Owners (4 Users):

Can ONLY see their own data.

Strict Isolation: Absolutely NO access to other owners' personal tenant lists, specific shop lists, or private financial details.

Common Data: Owners have read access to "Common Expenses", "Common Rental", and "Common Account" data, but this must be distinct from private owner data.

2. Database Schema Updates (Requirements)

Please ensure the database (PostgreSQL or Firestore) implements the following:

Users Table: Add a role field ('super_admin' or 'owner').

Data Tables (Tenants, Expenses, ShopLists, etc.):

Add an owner_id foreign key column to every single private record.

Ensure queries strictly filter by this owner_id when the user is not an Admin.

3. Dashboard & UI Layout

Create a new "Owner Summary" page (/owners/:id) that replicates the layout of a standard property management financial summary.

Header: Owner Name & Estate Summary.

Key Metrics Cards (Top Row):

Total Revenue (Personal)

Total Expenses (Personal + Share of Common)

Net Income

Occupancy Rate

Tabs/Sections:

My Tenants: List of tenants linked specifically to this owner.

Financials: A breakdown of "Shop Lists Expenses" vs. "Common Expenses".

Reports: Downloadable PDF/CSV buttons for their specific data range.

4. Implementation Logic (Critical)

Middleware/Backend: In all API endpoints GET /api/data, check the user's session.

if (user.role === 'super_admin') -> Return all records.

if (user.role === 'owner') -> Force append WHERE owner_id = current_user.id.

Frontend:

If Super Admin logs in: Show a dropdown to "Select Owner View" or "View All".

If Owner logs in: Redirect immediately to their personal Dashboard. Remove all navigation links to "All Owners" or "Global Settings".

5. Specific Visual Style

Use a clean, card-based layout (Tailwind CSS preferred). Ensure the "Summary" page looks professional, with clear distinction between "My Private Data" and "Common/Shared Data".
