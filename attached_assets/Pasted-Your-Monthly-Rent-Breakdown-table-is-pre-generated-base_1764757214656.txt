Your Monthly Rent Breakdown table is pre-generated based on the lease:

Month	Due Date	Rent Amount	Paid
August 2025	2025-08-01	৳5,500.00	-
September 2025	2025-09-01	৳5,500.00	-
October 2025	2025-10-01	৳5,500.00	৳5,500.00 (paid)
November 2025	2025-11-01	৳5,500.00	-
December 2025	2025-12-01	৳5,500.00	-

➡️ This means your system currently calculates monthly rent dues automatically, based only on start date + fixed rent.
➡️ And it only marks a month as Paid when a payment entry is recorded that matches that month.

✅ What You Want (Based on Your Message)
✔ When a user selects a month in the Payment Form, the Monthly Rent Breakdown should update accordingly.

Right now, your Payment Form probably looks like:

Tenant Name

Select Month (Dropdown)

Amount Paid (Input)

Pay Now

But your backend is likely saving only a payment record, not updating the correct month in the rent breakdown.

🎯 Your Exact Requirement Explained Clearly
❗ Requirement:

When the user selects a month on the Payment Form, that payment should be linked directly to the correct month in the Monthly Rent Breakdown table.

✔ Means:

If the user selects:

Month: August 2025

Paid: 3,000

Then the table should show:

Month	Due Date	Rent Amount	Paid
August 2025	2025-08-01	৳5,500.00	৳3,000.00

And not show paid in any other month.

📌 Current Problem (From the Screenshot)

Even though you can select the month in the payment form,
➡ Your table is not reading the saved payment month properly.

You have only October 2025 marked as paid, so that part works.
But your UI does not dynamically reflect other payments because:

❌ Your Monthly Rent Breakdown is using:

payments.filter(month == due_month).sum(amount)

BUT your Payment Form may be storing:

Payment date

Amount
❌ Not storing “Payment Month” or “Rent Period”

Meaning the system doesn’t know which month the payment belongs to.

✅ What You Need to Implement
1️⃣ Add a field in the payment form:

rent_period_month (e.g., 2025-08, 2025-09, etc.)

2️⃣ Save this value into the database.
3️⃣ When rendering Monthly Rent Breakdown:

Match Rent Month with Payment Month.

🔍 Example: Correct Expected Behavior

User selects September 2025 → Pays 2,000

Table should show:

Month	Rent	Paid
August 2025	5,500	-
September 2025	5,500	2,000
October 2025	5,500	5,500
November 2025	5,500	-
